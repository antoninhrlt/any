# any
Transform any object into any(thing)

## Note
As I mentioned [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/6635), a 
user prevents crate names to be used by the community. Waiting to get the "any" 
crate name, use this crate as following:

In "Cargo.toml"
```toml
[dependencies]
any = { git = "https://github.com/antoninhrlt/any" }
```
